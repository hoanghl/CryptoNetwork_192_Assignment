          <h1>Some Sports Article</h1>
          <p>American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron,
            is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. 
            The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by 
            running with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to 
            stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>Ter Stegen: the German's incredible run of 499 minutes with a goal being scored in his net ended. His interventions were still both necessary and important. Ter Stegen saved from Nolito at the end of the game, which saved Barcelona's blushes too. Another save from Nolito when it was 1-2 was important too. The goalkeeper saved from Brais in the first half and from Aspas before that. Couldn't do anything for either goal. He did commit an error in the first half with the ball at his feet but at a very high level for the rest of the game, as usual - 8.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material. (Modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather.) It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.</p>
