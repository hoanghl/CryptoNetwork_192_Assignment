                    <p>American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as
                        gridiron,
                        is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at
                        each end.
                        The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the
                        field by
                        running with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball,
                        aims to
                        stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves.</p>

                        <p>The Voice is an American singing competition television series broadcast on NBC. It premiered
                            during the spring television cycle on April 26, 2011. Based on the original The Voice of
                            Holland, and part of The Voice franchise it has aired seventeen seasons and aims to find
                            currently unsigned singing talent (solo or duets, professional and amateur) contested by

                    </h3>
                    <p>Ter Stegen: the German's incredible run of 499 minutes with a goal being scored in his net ended.
                        His interventions were still both necessary and important. Ter Stegen saved from Nolito at the
                        end of the game, which saved Barcelona's blushes too. Another save from Nolito when it was 1-2
                        was important too. The goalkeeper saved from Brais in the first half and from Aspas before that.
                        Couldn't do anything for either goal. He did commit an error in the first half with the ball at
                        his feet but at a very high level for the rest of the game, as usual - 8.</p>

                        <p>The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo
                            Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are
                            struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material. (Modern hammers are covered
                            with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather.) It is played using a keyboard, which
                            is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers
                            and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.</p>
